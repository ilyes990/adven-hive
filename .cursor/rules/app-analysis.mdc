    üéØ RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION ORDER
    Start with Phase 1 (Critical Features):
    Item Selection Bottom Sheet - Core functionality
    Final Checklist View - Complete user journey
    AI Integration Enhancement - Connect everything
    Then Phase 2 (User Feedback):
    Custom Dialog Components - Better UX
    Enhanced Snackbar System - User guidance
    Form Validation & Feedback - Polish
    Finally Phase 3 & 4 for polish and optimization.
